# Welcome to the *fresca* project!  

## == BRIEF DESCRIPTION ==

This project aims to develop a temperature controller for beer fermenters (at least 8). The controller is based on an Arduino and the DS18B20 digital temperature sensor. It will support setting temperature operating point with hystheresis via an LCD Keypad shield, and support temperature display with additional 7-segment displays for each sensor. The controller will open valves (with relays) carrying cold liquid (water) that will run inside the fermenter through a serpentine coil thus cooling the beer.  

Project parts:  
* Arduino Mega 2560 or similar (depending on how many fermenters are needed)  
* LCD keypad shield (1) 
* DS18B20 digital temperature sensor with OneWire interface (as many as needed)  
* 7-segment displays (as many as needed)  
* 5v Relays (as many as needed)  

All the parts are readily-available arduino parts, so there should be no trouble getting them.  

PD: The project is called 'fresca' in reference to Argentinian slang word used to describe a cold beer! :)
